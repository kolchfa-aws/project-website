meta_description: Learn how OpenSearch segment replication increases index throughput and lowers compute costs by performing heavy indexing workloads only on primary shards.
excerpt: In February of 2023, the OpenSearch Projects team talked to seven OpenSearch community members about their experience with using OpenSearch Dashboards. These community members were selected because they responded to a call for participants in one of our community meetings. We wanted to recruit OpenSearch community members who regularly created dashboards, so we could explore their pain points and frustrations. Dashboards are typically created by community members who either consume the dashboards themselves, or they create dashboards that are consumed by their community members (that is, dashboard consumers).

In February of 2023, the OpenSearch Projects team talked to seven OpenSearch community members about their experience with using OpenSearch Dashboards. These community members were selected because they responded to a call for participants in one of our community meetings. We wanted to recruit OpenSearch community members who regularly created dashboards, so we could explore their pain points and frustrations. Dashboards are typically created by community members who either consume the dashboards themselves, or they create dashboards that are consumed by their community members (that is, dashboard consumers).

The study participants contextualized OpenSearch as a developer tool, and highlighted the need to simplify things for community members who attempted to “just create dashboards.” The participants noted that they struggled with the usability of dashboards, found the dashboard offerings limited, and shared frustrations with learnability, discoverability, and the complexity of integrating with their platform’s UI. They shared other frustrations with regards to documentation, dashboard creation, sharing, anomaly detection, and usage of space on the OpenSearch dashboards.

While some participants called out the importance of setting up the index templates correctly for an improved downstream experience, others highlighted frustrations with this step in dashboard creation as being distinct from the experience of creating dashboards on other tools. Participants also called out the benefits of creating standards in the encoding and permissions process.

Participants called out many inconsistencies and deficiencies in the visualization functionality in OpenSearch. This included color coding, interchangeability of charts, filter application, and zooming in and out of a chart. Given the range of dashboard creator needs, participants expect OpenSearch to streamline dashboard creation, and in addition, provide enhanced functionality in order to maximize usage of OpenSearch dashboards. Ultimately, participants want to have a quick and easy way to set up the basic essentials for dashboarding, and then make sure the dashboarding process is part of the automation (that is, CICD pipeline).

When asked what their ideal dashboard experience would be, we obtained a variety of responses that indicated deficiencies in the current OpenSearch dashboard experience. Participants wanted basic abilities stemming from a need for increased usability, simplicity, and a confidence in knowing that what they were seeing in dashboards helped them solve their immediate business problem. Some other participants were more aspirational in sharing what they would want in an ideal dashboard experience, and described a need for automated visualizations based on common data structures that can be identified in the user’s data.

We are currently reviewing and consolidating all feedback. Further studies are taking place over the course of the next few months, and we encourage you to participate. Our roadmap is completely driven by community members, like you. If you are interested, please join our bi-weekly community meetings to hear about opportunities for future studies, or sign up here. Thanks so much for reading and we look forward to continued input from the OpenSearch community.
